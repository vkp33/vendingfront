# Vending Machine Front End

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Before running, make sure NPM and Node are installed! You can check the versions of NPM and Node with the commands "npm -v" and "node -v" respectively. If you're missing either of them click [this link](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) to download them.

## To run the project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` within the terminal 

(If you want to run the Vending API locally instead of using the hosted project, run the api first and then run this project afterwards. You would also have to change all references in the project of 'https://vending-machine-project.herokuapp.com' to 'http://localhost:3000' so it's probably easier to run this part as is.)

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## How to use
 
Simply mouse over each item and if there's any available stock, click purchase! Make sure you allow downloads in your browser and corresponding JSON file will be downloaded shortly after. (P.S. Turn on sound for the full experience).
